                <H2>Who we are</H2>
                <P>
                  Robson Studio (&ldquo;Robson Studio&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;)
                  is a sole-operator design studio run by Dan Robson, based in Newcastle,
                  Australia. You can reach us at{' '}
                  <A href="mailto:dan@robson.studio">dan@robson.studio</A>.
                </P>

                <H2>Scope</H2>
                <P>
                  This policy covers personal information collected through the website at{' '}
                  <strong>robson.studio</strong> and through any web or desktop applications
                  operated by Robson Studio that link to this policy, including applications
                  that authenticate users via Google.
                </P>

                <H2>Information we collect</H2>
                <P>We may collect the following categories of information:</P>
                <Ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Information you provide directly</strong> &mdash; such as your name,
                    email address, and the content of any messages you send us.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Account and authentication data</strong> &mdash; if you sign in to
                    one of our applications, we receive the basic profile information returned
                    by the identity provider (for example, your name, email, and profile image
                    from Google).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>User content</strong> &mdash; data you authorise an application to
                    read, create, or modify on your behalf (for example, files, calendar events,
                    or messages from connected services).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Technical data</strong> &mdash; standard server logs including IP
                    address, browser type, and pages visited, used to operate and secure the
                    service.
                  </li>
                </Ul>

                    affirmative consent for specific data, it is necessary for security, to
                    comply with applicable law, or the data is aggregated and used for
                    internal operations in accordance with applicable rules; and</li>
                  <li>do not use Google user data to train, fine-tune, or improve generalised
